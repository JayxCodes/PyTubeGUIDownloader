# PyTubeGUIDownloader
This project is a small graphical interface to download YouTube videos. I will be slowly improving the interface over time to be more user friendly and efficient. 

There is built in redundencies in case the user fails to input any data or fails to provide proper data(except the URL). 

Required packages are simple: 
 * PySimpleGUI
 * pytube
 
 I realize PySimpleGUI isn't needed, and tinkter built into python works, but this helps simplify the codebase for myself.
